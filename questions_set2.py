        "Devices listen to the network before transmitting. If a collision occurs, they stop transmitting, wait for a random period, and then attempt to transmit again.",
        "Devices transmit data at the same time without checking for other transmissions, and then correct any detected errors only after the data has been fully transmitted.",
        "Devices first establish a secure, dedicated communication channel with the destination, ensuring that no other devices can interfere before they begin transmitting data.",
        "Devices apply complex encryption protocols to secure data transmission, which not only ensures data privacy but also prevents collisions by making each transmission unique."
